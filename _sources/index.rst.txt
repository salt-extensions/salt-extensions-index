The Salt extensions listed in this index are collected by searching `PyPi`_ for packages
starting with ``salt-ext-``, ``saltext-`` or ``saltext.`` in their name, or, preferably,
by having ``salt-extension`` in the package's `keywords`_ metadata entry:

An effort is made to automatically test these packages against the latest 3 major releases
of salt. For this to happen, the package:

* Must use `nox`_ to run it's test suite
* Must provide a source distribution which includes a ``noxfile.py``
* The ``noxfile.py`` must implement a ``tests-3`` session
* The ``noxfile.py`` must check the environment for a ``SALT_REQUIREMENT`` keyword which should be installed into the `nox`_ session. (Example ``SALT_REQUIREMENT=salt==3004.0``)
