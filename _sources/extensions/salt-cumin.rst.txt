Description
-----------
======
Cumin
======

Cumin contains a Python library and CLI scripts for accessing a remote
`salt-api`__ instance.

``cumin`` abstracts the HTTP calls to ``salt-api`` so existing Python
projects can easily integrate with a remote Salt installation just by
instantiating a class.

The ``cumin`` CLI script allows users to execute Salt commands from computers
that are external to computers running the ``salt-master`` or ``salt-minion``
daemons as though they were running Salt locally. The long-term goal is to add
additional CLI scripts maintain the same interface as Salt's own CLI scripts
(``salt``, ``salt-run``, ``salt-key``, etc).
